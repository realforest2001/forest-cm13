// Used to hold mutator-specific state and encompass mutator-specific behavior, such as on-hit effects.

///////////////////////////////////
//
// How this code works
//
// Basically, I inserted 'hooks' in all the relevant locations that call these procs whenever the xeno takes damage,
// lands a slash, etc. The goal functionality is to modularize all extra behavior needed by strains in one place.
// One of these is instanced onto every xeno and is also used to track all additional state needed by the strain itself.
//
// Addendum
//
// This datum is meant to be M.O.D.U.L.A.R, you should NOT assume your delegate will be held by any specific xenomorph.
// This also means xenomorphs should NOT assume they have any delegate in particular, if your strain/caste needs to call a specific proc from their
// specific delegate, reconsider its necessity, this is for shared behaviors, not a proc holder for snowflake procs.
//
// However this doesn't mean the delegate shouldn't have special interactions with specific actions (ie. the ones from your strain/caste), that's perfectly fine,
// but remember that the delegate is the one to dictate behaviors, not the other way around, your actions shouldn't make calls to the delegate
//
// A brief flowchart
//   xeno New() -OR- strain applicator
// |
//  constructs
//    \/
//  behavior_delegate
//    attack procs  <- called by attacking code
//    ability procs <- called by action code, use them for ability-passive interactions
//    other stuff   <- called in xeno Life, etc
//    constant variables <- used as balancing values for strains, etc
//    state variables <- used to store all strain-unique state associated with THIS xeno.
